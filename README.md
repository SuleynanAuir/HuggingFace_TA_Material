## 📘 Emotion Classification with BERT — Beginner Cloud Pipeline Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a **cloud-based emotional text classification system** using [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/), modular pipelines, and deploy it with Hugging Face **Spaces** for real-time web-based prediction.

---

### 🌟 Overview

This beginner-friendly tutorial covers:

* ✅ Building an emotion classification model using BERT
* ✅ Loading and preprocessing self-generated emotional text data
* ✅ Tokenizing and batching data using Hugging Face `datasets`
* ✅ Training a simple classification model (`my_finetuned_model`)
* ✅ Writing clean and modular `pipeline` components
* ✅ Saving models to the Hugging Face Hub
* ✅ Deploying an interactive web interface using Hugging Face Spaces

| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🤗 Hugging Face Transformers     | Uses BERT base model with Hugging Face's Trainer API              |
| 🔄 Modular Pipeline              | Each step (data, model, train, evaluate) is reusable and isolated |
| 🧪 Three-Class Emotion Detection | Labels: 0 (negative), 1 (positive), 2 (neutral)                   |
| ⚙️ Custom Loss Function          | Includes `FocalLoss` with optional `Label Smoothing`              |
| 📈 Real-Time Evaluation Logging  | Logs average prediction confidence using `wandb`                  |
| ☁️ Hugging Face Spaces           | Final model is deployed to a cloud Web UI using Streamlit/Gradio  |

### 📦 Requirements

```bash
pip install transformers datasets wandb gradio
```

---

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourname/my_finetune_pipeline.git
   cd my_finetune_pipeline
   ```

2. Add your `train.csv` and `test.csv` files:

   ```csv
   text,label
   I love this product!,1
   This is terrible.,0
   I received the item.,2
   ```

3. Run the training pipeline:

   ```bash
   python run_pipeline.py --epochs 3 --batch_size 16 --lr 2e-5
   ```

4. (Optional) Push model to Hugging Face Hub:

   ```python
   model.push_to_hub("your_username/my-finetuned-bert")
   ```

---

### 🌐 Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces

You can use [Gradio](https://gradio.app) or [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) inside a `app.py`:

```python
import gradio as gr
from transformers import pipeline

clf = pipeline("text-classification", model="your_username/my-finetuned-bert")

def predict(text):
    result = clf(text)[0]
    return f"{result['label']} ({result['score']:.2f})"

gr.Interface(fn=predict, inputs="text", outputs="text").launch()
```

Push this to a Hugging Face Space repository and your real-time demo is live!

---

### 📊 Visualization (Optional with wandb)

Use [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) for tracking:

```bash
wandb login
```

Automatically logs:

* Training loss
* Evaluation metrics
* Average confidence per epoch

---
